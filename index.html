Each player places a fleet of ships on a grid without revealing their positions. Players take turns by clicking on opponent's grid cells to locate and sink their opponent's ships. The first to sink all of their opponent's ships wins. It's a game of deduction, strategy, and skill.</p><form action="#"><label for="player-name">Please Enter your name to proceed</label> <input name="player-name" id="player-name"/> <button type="submit" class="form-button">Proceed</button></form></div><div class="main-container" id="main-container-id"><div id="player-details"><div class="player-table-container"><p>Player Sea</p><table id="playerTable"></table></div><div class="player-ships-class" draggable="false"></div></div><div class="computer-table-container" id="computer-details"><p>Computer Sea</p><table id="computerTable"></table></div></div></body></html>
